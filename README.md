# 🚀 WhatsApp Web Automation in VB6

This project, developed in **Visual Basic 6**, provides a solution for automating message sending through **WhatsApp Web** using two navigation engines:

* 🧩 **RC6 + WebView2** (Project by Olaf Schmidt)
* 🤖 **SeleniumBasic**

The application allows selecting the desired engine and executing messaging tasks in an integrated manner.

## ✨ Main Features

### **1. 💬 Sending Text Messages**

Both **WebView2** and **SeleniumBasic** can send messages to contacts or groups. Messages may include:

* Text
* Emojis 😃🔥🎉👌

### **2. 📁 Sending Files (SeleniumBasic only)**

With **SeleniumBasic**, the following can be sent:

* 🖼️ Images
* 📄 Documents
* 🎞️ Videos

> ⚠️ This functionality is not available with WebView2.

### **3. 🧱 RC6 Integration (Olaf)**

The project uses **RC6** framework components to integrate WebView2 into VB6, enabling:

* Modern navigation inside the form
* JavaScript execution
* Interaction with HTML elements

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### **🧩 RC6 + WebView2**

* Based on Olaf Schmidt's work
* Provides a modern browser inside VB6
* Allows sending messages through JavaScript injection

### **🤖 SeleniumBasic**

* Browser automation (Chrome/Edge)
* Full DOM access
* Support for sending files and messages
* 🔄 **Automatic WebDriver Updating**: The project includes an additional application developed specifically to update WebDrivers automatically. This tool handles downloading, replacing, and verifying the required driver versions, ensuring Selenium always works with the correct components.
